# EmergencyHandler
### A complete emergency response system

EmergencyHandler was developed with the sole aim of providing an ecosystem for dealing with emergencies. Compatible with any emergency, it maps the GPS coordinates received via supporting apps and plots the nearest resources. The drivers page also plots routes between common locations in the city. Combined with data analytics, EmergencyHandler can be used to identify heat-maps, charts and graphs regarding emergencies. Integrated with a dedicated user login system.

To test, run
```
 npm install
 node app.js
```
If you're using this in your own project, make sure you have mongodb installed and firebase keys changed according to your requirements.
